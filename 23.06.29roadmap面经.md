#### Q1: Can you briefly explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development? 
A1:
- high-level programming language, primarily used for web development, add interactivity and dynamic features to websites
- executed on the client-side, meaning it runs directly in the user's web browser
- enables tasks such as form validation, DOM manipulation, handling events, and making asynchronous requests to servers

#### Q2: How does JavaScript differ from other programming languages? 
A2:
- interpreted language, meaning it doesn't require compilation (translate into machine language) before execution 
	- (!!!BUT, modern JavaScript engines, such as V8 in Google Chrome, use a combination of interpretation and just-in-time (JIT) compilation techniques. 
	- JIT compilation can optimize the performance of JavaScript by dynamically compiling frequently executed code segments into machine code for faster execution. 
	- So, while JavaScript is often referred to as an interpreted language, it incorporates some compilation techniques for performance optimization.)
- dynamically typed, which allows for flexibility but also requires careful handling of data types
- has a strong focus on web development and provides specific features for working with HTML, CSS, and the Document Object Model (DOM)
	- **DOM** is a programming **interface** that represents the **structure of an HTML or XML document** as a **tree-like structure**. 
		- DOM is like a control of an air conditioner. We can use that to organize and play with all things (elements, attributes...) on a webpage
		- **DOM is the underlying structure** that **allows JavaScript to interact with and modify** the **content of a web page**, making it a fundamental component in the development of single-page applications.
	- **JavaScript** can be used to **build various types of web applications, including** both **single-page applications (using frameworks like React)** and multi-page applications.
		- A **single-page application (SPA)** is a **specific type of web application architecture** where the **content is loaded dynamically on a single web page**, ~~without the need for full page reloads~~.
		- JavaScript doesn't automatically make an application a single-page application.
		- **React**, as a **JavaScript library**, is often used in the development of single-page applications. React provides tools and components that facilitate the creation of SPAs by efficiently **managing the virtual DOM** and **enabling dynamic content updates**.
		- There are other frameworks and libraries, such as Angular and Vue.js, that can also be used to create single-page applications using JavaScript.

#### Q3: What are some common use cases or applications of JavaScript in web development?
A3:
   - Adding interactivity to websites by responding to user actions, such as button clicks or form submissions. 
   - Validating user input on web forms to ensure data is entered correctly before submission. 
   - Creating dynamic content and updating elements on a webpage without requiring a full page reload. 
   - Implementing client-side form validation to provide immediate feedback to users. 
   - Building web applications, including single-page applications (SPAs), using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. 
   - Making asynchronous requests to servers using AJAX or Fetch API to fetch data from APIs and update the webpage accordingly.
