- user
	- [change username or password](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12720967/how-can-i-change-a-postgresql-user-password) 
		- `sudo -u xx-username psql xxx-dbname` (log in without a password)
		- `ALTER USER xx-username RENAME TO xx-new-username;`
		- `ALTER USER xx-username WITH PASSWORD 'xx-new-password';`
- database
	- create
		- method 1: `CREATE DATABASE mydb1(xx-dbname);` in **psql**
			- !!! [don't forget `;`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13321005/postgresql-not-creating-db-with-createdb-as-superuser-yet-not-outputting-erro) , or the psql will waiting till `;` appears
		- method 2: `createdb -U(user) postgres(xx-username) mydb2(xx-dbname)` in **cmd**
			- [error after `createdb mydb2(xx-dbname)`](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/postgres-create-database) : `createdb : The term 'createdb' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.`
				- reason: Occurs when PostgreSQL was not installed properly. Run **`createdb`** from the PostgreSQL installation path or add the **psql.exe** path to the system variables section in PC advanced settings.
				- solution 1: add the **psql.exe** [path to the system variables](https://sqlbackupandftp.com/blog/setting-windows-path-for-postgres-tools/) section in **Edit the system environment variales**, then `createdb -U postgres(xx-username) mydb2(xx-dbname)`

						- reason: Since your directory name contains _spaces_, you must _quote_ it
						- solution: use `cd 'C:\PostgreSQL\16\bin'` instead

								Suggestion [3,General]: The command createdb was not found, but does exist in the current location. Windows PowerShell does not load commands from the current location by default. If you trust this command, instead type: ".\createdb". See "get-help about_Command_Precedence" for more details.

								- solution: `.\createdb mydb2(xx-dbname)`
									- error: wrong password `createdb: error: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "xx"`
										- reason: didn't use right username
										- solution: `.\createdb -U postgres(xx-username) mydb2(xx-dbname)`
		- method 3: use **pgAdmin**

		- check `\l`/`\list` in **psql** to ensure db created successfully
	- [choose](https://www.runoob.com/postgresql/postgresql-select-database.html)

	- [delete](https://www.runoob.com/postgresql/postgresql-drop-database.html) 
		- method 1: `DROP DATABASE mydb1(xx-dbname);` in **psql**
			- !!! don't forget `;`
- table
	- directly ([table should be created under schema](https://www.cnblogs.com/cqdba/p/15919085.html) . so, in fact, this way uses a default `public` schema which is created by PostgreSQL when installing.)
		- [create](https://www.runoob.com/postgresql/postgresql-create-table.html) 
			- method 1:  in **psql**
				- !!! don't forget `,` in each column; !!! don't add `,` in the last column; indent is optional
				```SQL
				CREATE TABLE mytable1(xx-tablename)(
					ID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, 
				NAME TEXT,
				SALARY REAL
				);
				```
			- check `\d` in **psql** to ensure table created successfully
			- check `SELECT * FROM mytable1;` to read content in table
		- [delete](https://www.runoob.com/postgresql/postgresql-drop-table.html) 
			- method 1: `DROP TABLE mytable1(xx-tablename);`(delete one table) or `DROP TABLE mytable1, mytable2;`(delete 2 tables) in **psql**
				- !!! don't forget `;`
	- [through schema](https://www.runoob.com/postgresql/postgresql-schema.html) 
		- create
			- method 1: `CREATE SCHEMA myschema1(xx-schemaname);`+
				```SQL
				CREATE TABLE myschema1.mytable2(xx-tablename)(
					ID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, 
					NAME TEXT,
					SALARY REAL
				);
				```
				- !!! create schema before create table in that schema
			- check `\dn` in **psql** to ensure schema created successfully
			- check `SELECT * FROM myschema1.mytable2;` to read content in table
		- delete
			- method 1: `DROP SCHEMA myschema1;`(delete an empty schema), or `DROP SCHEMA myschema1 CASCADE;`(delete a schema+ all of it's objects)
