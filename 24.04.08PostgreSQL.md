Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.`
				- reason: Occurs when PostgreSQL was not installed properly. Run **`createdb`** from the PostgreSQL installation path or add the **psql.exe** path to the system variables section in PC advanced settings.
				- solution 1: add the **psql.exe** [path to the system variables](https://sqlbackupandftp.com/blog/setting-windows-path-for-postgres-tools/) section in **Edit the system environment variales**, then `createdb -U postgres(xx-username) mydb2(xx-dbname)`

								Suggestion [3,General]: The command createdb was not found, but does exist in the current location. Windows PowerShell does not load commands from the current location by default. If you trust this command, instead type: ".\createdb". See "get-help about_Command_Precedence" for more details.

								- solution: `.\createdb mydb2(xx-dbname)`
									- error: wrong password `createdb: error: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 5432 failed: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "xx"`
